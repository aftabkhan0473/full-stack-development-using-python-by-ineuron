# 1. Write a python script to remove the last digit from a given number. (for example, if user enters 2534 then your output should be 253)
given_number = int(input("Enter a number which you like to remove the last digit : "))
final_number = int(given_number/10)
print(f"The final number by removing last digit is {final_number}")

# 2. Write a python script to get the last digit from a given number. (for example, if user enters 2089 then your output should be 9)

given_number2= int(input("Enter a number which you like to know last digit : "))
final_number2 = given_number2%10;
print(f"So Last digit of {given_number2} is {final_number2}")

# 3. Write a python script to swap data of two variables.
